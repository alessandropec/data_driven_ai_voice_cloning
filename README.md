# Data driven AI voice cloning

This repository is an implementation of the main part of my master thesis in Data science & Engineering.
It is divided in two part:

1. Speaker Encoder (models: ECAPA-TDNN, wavlm-series)
2. Text-to-speech (model: FastSpeech2 microsoft implementation)

This two part are then integrated to achieve a Multi Speaker Text to Speech model that is capable of cloning unseen voices starting from about 5 seconds of audio.
